- Play the audio file for a word when it's available
- Switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts
- Switch between light and dark themes
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Bonus: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. Hint: Research prefers-color-scheme in CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- React Router
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

- After doing a React Router v6 course, I tried to apply it to this project
- Used error and loading state
- Using a loading animation 
- Using audio 


### Continued development
I would like to continue to use React Router, and get more comfortable with it, especially in a bigger project


### Useful resources

- [Toggle Switch](https://dev.to/larainfo/toggle-switch-in-react-js-with-tailwind-css-example-jfk) - I used this for the toggle switch
- [Theme Switch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VylXkPy-MIc) - This is short and simple youtube tutorial which I have used many times.
- [Loading animation](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_loader.asp) - I used this for the loading animation, I would like to do more loading animations in the future, I think it really adds to the project
